Your task is to collaborate with the entire team to make a new Git project work!

First, clone the project to your local machine in a new, empty folder.
Second, on your local machine, create your own branch. Name it "dev/<YOUR NAME HERE>".
Third, in the "features" folder, create your own feature! Name it "<YOUR NAME HERE>.txt". Put some text in the feature. Then, create another feature called "common.txt". Put some more text in the common feature.
Fourth, push the feature to the Github.
Fifth, find a friend's branch to merge with. Create a pull request. See me once you've gotten this step done.
